# Proposal: %loam — Golem + Urbit Dev Suite Grab Bag

## Elevator Pitch

Right now, building on Urbit is building on hard mode. The developer experience has much to be desired when it comes to project creation, testing, and deploying, gaps that ultimately make incoming developers more likely to churn. As more peer to peer OS and/or application environment projects come to market, Urbit will need to bridge it's best in class kernel and systems level design, with equally robust dev tools across it's stack on both Urth and Mars.

In order to terraform Mars, Urbit will need a rich soil to grow its software. In other words, it needs %loam — a loosely-coupled set of opinionated standards and dev tools that connect the existing software and tooling into a cohesive and consistent model, so that apps being built in different parts of the terrain are more inter-navigable, and interoperable.

# Overview

## Purpose

Rather than proposing a single specific piece of software with sequential milestones, this document describes a "grab bag" of useful developer tools that can be built in any order or even in parallel. We are consolidating them here for ease of review, as well as to show how they are loosely united under a common initiative. 

The main goals of these standards and tools are to make Urbit development more:
1. **Cohesive** — It should be easy and painless to have all of the state-of-the art dev tools in your Ubrit projects out of the box, and working together
2. **Consistent** — Piping between dev tools should be consistent across different projects, it should be effortless to implement best practices when starting your projects, so that devs from other projects can open it up and immediately understand what is going on

## Scope

Here is a shortlist of things that need to be solved for this goal:

* Project Creation 
* Code Scaffolding for Hoon
* An opinionated framework for Hoon
* Binary Management
* Package/Dependency Management
* Standardized Continuous Deployment Pipeline within Mars
* Urth-side livereload
* Urth -> Mars Message passing
* IAC (Infrastructure as Code) For Dev Envs
* A drop-in solution for NoSQL Data 
* DID Resolution

You should be able to take advantage of these things — \
— whether you are developing in Mars or Urth, \
— whether you are building in javascript or Hoon or a mixture of the two, and \
— whether you are building a generator, agent, or webapp. 

This allows for flexibility where it is important to devs while providing opinions and standards for the things that get overlooked and take up development time when creating new projects and companies. 

![CYOA](./img/CYOA.png)
Essentially, Urbit is ripe for a full-stack framework: a set of standards for how to structure Hoon and Javascript projects as well as tooling for creating, scaffolding, and distributing projects.

In order to facilitate this, there are a few different things that need to be built:
1. **CLI (golem)** — and Urth-side CLI for project creation, scaffolding, and binary & dependency management
2. **Dojo Tool/IDE** — a desk of threads and opinionated pill for project creation, scaffolding, and binary & dependency management in Mars. 
3. **JS IPC Library (clack)** — a js wrapper around conn.c to make your fake-ships scriptable from JS on MacOS
4. **BaaS** — a desk for a NoSQL Store that can be used as a BaaS, allowing JS-first developers to move business logic to the frontend
5. **Package Manager** — an Urbit instance of an [Egyn]() registry for managing packages, binaries, and other Urbit artefacts, as well as a GUI to browse them
6. **DID Resolver** — the ability to use your @p as a DID that resolves documents on an urbit ship

In addition, there are some integrations that don't fit neatly into one of these projects, included in this document as well. 

The Second part of this proposal doc will go into each of these in more detail. First we will paint a 500 ft view of how these fit together into a consistent workflow.

## Workflow

The goal of providing these tools is to free up developer time and creativity from reimplementing the piping between layers of an app all the time, as well as to standardize key steps in the SDLC for Urbit so that primitives being built and shared loosely conform to legible conventions. Namely, it should be trivial to create, compose, test, and deploy/publish an app from your local environment, whether on Urth or Mars.

![SDLC](./img/SDLC.png)

This process can be broken down further for both Urth and Mars development as seen below:

![URTH](./img/SDLC-URTH.png)

![MARS](./img/SDLC-URBIT.png)

These diagrams highlight where the steps of the SDLC require different tooling from different environments, while still preserving the ability to have one set of best practices and project structure within a given app. 

Here is a 500 Foot view of how the these fit together from end to end:

## golem — Design

Golem is a  CLI for creating projects, managing dependencies, running a test env, and publishing your app. It uses a templating system to create new projects and add scaffolding to existing ones, emphasizing IAC in order to preserve consistency and allow teams to iterate on best practices for common activities in an Urbit app. It manages both code dependencies (think /lib/mydep.Hoon) as well as desk dependencies. The structure of the projects and test envs are included in the engineering designs of this section, as well as a diagram of which low-level interactions are handled at each step.

### Engineering Design

Here is how the SDLC differs for dojo/Mars:

![IMAGE](./img/SDLC-URBIT.png)

## BaaS — Design

The BaaS agent will let frontend developers use their desk as a backend-as-a-service using NoSQL. The frontend library will be able to store JSON records at a particular path and retrieve it later. Paths whose children conform to specific constraints will also be able to be used as a list, and get additional functionality like querying and pagination. Permissions will be specified on a per-path basis and will nest. Other ships with the appropriate permissions will be allowed to subscribe to a particular path on your ship and receive updates for them to keep a replica of the data. This functionality should cover most use cases that just need CRUD and pub/sub functionality for their DB. But if there is a need for data to be updated on record change, or if there is a need to update different parts of the tree with ACID guarantees, that functionality can be added with threads. Which will allow for powerful capabilities in Hoon right out of the gate, while preserving the option to naturally extend compatibility once wasm can target Urbit threads with other languages.

### Segments

* JS developer
* Hoon developer

### Stories

* As an Hoon Dev, I need to be able to include a NoSQL Store in my app state, so that I can store arbitrary trees of data
* As an JS Dev, I need to be able to read data at a path, so that i can reuse it
* As an JS Dev, I need to be able to add a record at a path, so that I can read it later
* As an JS Dev, I need to be able to add a list at a path, so that I can read it later
* As an JS Dev, I need to be able to update a record/list at a path, so that I can read it later
* As an JS Dev, I need to be able to replace a record/list at a path, so that I can read it later
* As an JS Dev, I need to be able to delete a record/list at a path, so that I can read it later
* As an JS Dev, I need to be able to set permissions on a path, so that I can restrict access to particular subscribers
* As an JS Dev, I need to be able to request subscription to a path on someone else's ship, so that I can be notified of updates
* As an Hoon Dev, I need to be able to specify hooks for a path, so that a thread can be run when a path is updated
* As an JS Dev, I need to be able to specify properties to index on a list, so that I can query and paginate on those props with denormalized data
* As an Hoon Dev, I need to be able to write transactions in a thread and bind to a path, so that I can make multiple ACID transactions on the state tree

### Engineering Design

A preliminary design for the baas agent can be modeled as follows:

![IMAGE](./img/baas-model.png)

In addition to the main state tree there is another collection for denormalized representations of the data and a tree for modelling subscriptions on foreign data. There are also stateful registries to keep track of threads used for hooks and transactions

## DID Resolver — Design
    * As a Urbit User, I can install a Gall Agent that resolves a DID Method on a document on my ship
    * As an Urbit Dev, I can %poke an Urbit ship with a DID using my patp to retrieve content from another ship via %scry
    * As a Urbit Dev, I can upload a DID document to my ship

Using the existing identity system methods can be accessed using my @p / signature algorithm. Owners of documents can view the entire JSON. The application will
allow me to attempt to resolve DID requests on other ships by using the content owners @p.

So given the following URL `did:patp:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1` the example document will be resolved to:

```json
{
  "id": "did:patp:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authentication": [{
    "id": "did:patp:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
    "controller": "did:patp:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyBase58": "..."
  }],
  "service": [{
		"id": "did:patp:123456789abcdefghi#agent",
		"type": "AgentService",
		"serviceEndpoint": "https://agent.example.com/8377464"
	}],
  "metadata" : [...],
}
```

If one were to derefence the URL after authentication by resolving: `did:patp:123456789abcdefghi?metadata` to get the associated fields.
To talk to an endpoint / get content:
%poke with this string `did:patp:123456789abcdefghi?service&relativeRef=%2Fsome%2Fpath%3Fquery#frag` -> `https://agent.example.com/8377464/some/path?query#frag`

# Milestones (Grab Bag)
